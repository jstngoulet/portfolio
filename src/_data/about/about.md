# Heyüëã, it's Justin Goulet, Mobile Engineering Manager @ HyreCar by Getaround

Hello there!

Integrity, Perseverance and Ambition. These are just 3 words that describe how I work
when given the opportunity. I noticed a role you have open on your site, seeking a skilled
Engineering Manager. While you have likely already seen several candidates recently, I
want to take a brief moment relaying how excited I am of the possibility of a conversation
and how I may be a good fit for your open role at your organization.

I first started developing mobile applications in 2012, while I was in school for my
Bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Science. While I was being taught the fundamentals in school, I
believed it really did not provide me with the ‚Äúhands-on‚Äù experience I was looking for.
With each new application created, I learned more and more about the application
ecosystem on iOS and the walled garden that hold it together.

My first professional role, however, wasn‚Äôt until 2017, upon successful completion of my
degree. At this point, I had built several applications that were once published on the app
store. My first role (Naked Development) allowed me to continue my curiosity as we
worked directly with entrepreneur‚Äôs of various backgrounds to bring their ideas to life.
During my tenure there, I was able to work on projects such as social networking
applications, finance projects, navigation tools and even projects that incorporated early
versions of AI (IBM‚Äôs Watson).

In a quest for a stable paycheck (previous role noted was a contractor role), I moved to
HyreCar/Getaround. Here, I was able to really build up my repertoire of skills and
knowledge as I was the only iOS developer on staff (even when our valuation soared to
$500 million+) for years. As we scaled our team later, I was able to stand in as the Mobile
Applications Engineering overseeing all of the mobile development in the organization.
During my tenure at HyreCar/Getaround, I was able to work with a variety of stakeholders
for numerous projects hitting our mobile application team, our largest client user base.
Projects involved product analytics integration, affiliate marketing attribution, document
verification analysis and several other projects, even hitting the Full-stack team (which I
also led for a short duration).

It would be an honor to share more information with you, if you feel that I may be a good
fit for your team. I believe that my various skills and enthusiasm for building exciting
products can have a great impact on your users - all of whom deserve excellence.


I look forward to meeting you,

Justin Goulet
