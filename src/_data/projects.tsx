          Built with a design to match professional applications, this productivity program was created to connect microbrews to the beer drinkers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea behind this application was that breweries are popping up all over San Diego, and other great counties, 
          and there is not a seamless way to find them all, follow them, and see what they are currently pouring on tap. Facebook 
          is a common option for many small businesses, but it is not specialized towards a physical product.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Beer Hopper, that changes. The mobile application uses your location to find breweries near you, sorting them by which is closest, and allows 
          users to view their entire beer list, just what is on tap, their average rating (for both the beers and the actual business), hours and more!

          No longer live, due to minimal interest, this application was still a great triumph for me. Working in a group of three (3), 
          we were able to successfully create a powerful application that was geared towards meeting new people and going to new places.
        </p>
        <p>
          Crony was an application that used peer location data (anonymous) that only kept a record of a location - not a specific user. 
          The application then used the location data to tell users how many people are near a particular business.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created the curent UI of the application, as well as the backend side of the local application. My job was to create a working version 
          of our product while another was in charge of maintaining the server and the other was in charge of promoting the finalized product.
