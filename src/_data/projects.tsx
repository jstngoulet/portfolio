          HyreCar is a "RideShare for GigShare" application that allows users of lower income or bad credit
          rent the vehicles of their peers in a simple to use marketplace.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was brouht into HyreCar in 2018 with the task of building their iOS application from scratch and 
          scaling it to support all of their users. We were able to release it on schedule and with added
          features, starting the true shift of mobility for a mobility platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          I managed this project between 2018 and the end of 2024, adding many of the well known features 
          like authentication/phone verification, their vetting process using document OCR and rental management while 
          also spearheading the product analytics integration for all clients (iOS, Android and Web).

          Built with a design to match professional applications, this productivity program was created to connect microbrews to the beer drinkers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea behind this application was that breweries are popping up all over San Diego, and other great counties, 
          and there is not a seamless way to find them all, follow them, and see what they are currently pouring on tap. Facebook 
          is a common option for many small businesses, but it is not specialized towards a physical product.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Beer Hopper, that changes. The mobile application uses your location to find breweries near you, sorting them by which is closest, and allows 
          users to view their entire beer list, just what is on tap, their average rating (for both the beers and the actual business), hours and more!

        </p>
        <p>
          Crony was an application that used peer location data (anonymous) that only kept a record of a location - not a specific user. 
          The application then used the location data to tell users how many people are near a particular business.

          The words range from 3 letter words to 5 letter words, each given a particular level of difficulty.

          them and place them in the correct square below. On medium, you are only provided a random amount of letters 
          and you have to figure out where they go. This level is also slightly tougher due to the word length starting at 
          4 (instead of three). Finally, you have hard, which starts you off at five letter words, without any hints.

          The addition, however, is that there are images for each of the projects noted on this page, a feature
          I plan on bringing to this site in the near future.

          Using the <InlineLink href='http://beerhopper.me'>Beer Hopper</InlineLink> app I created, the purpose of this website was to 
          introduce a more social experience than what was currently being offered.

          In a team of 5 people, we were able to transform an application into a functional website. As this project was a school project, 
          we were able to learn PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of the school project was to create a functional website using MySQL and allowed users to interact with the page content. 
          This meant that we had to develop a backend system that was scalable and able to handle content as normal users would.
        </p>
        <p>
          From project documentation, ERDs for the Database Implementation, wireframing and actual implementation, we spent countless 
          hours ensuring we had the best project in the class. Using <InlineLink href='http://github.com/'>GitHub</InlineLink> 
          as our version control system, our repository is publically viewable <InlineLink href='http://github.com/CSUSM-Web-Dev-F2016/f2016-Sem_Project'>here</InlineLink>.

          Starting with a NAND chip and VHDL as our language, the goal of this class was to learn how the structure of 
          the computer was built from just above the transisitors to the operating system and the application that it runs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The course was based off of an online course, found <InlineLink href='http://nand2tetris.org?refr_source=justin.goulet+portfolio@aol.com&campaign=portfolio&refr_medium=web'>
          here</InlineLink> and consisted of week-long portions. For example, we had one week to create the codes for
           all of our elementary gates, a week for the advanced gates, a week for the ALU, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the complexity of some systems, however, we were allowed 2 weeks for some projects including the Virtual 
          Machine and the Operating System.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each project, above the VHDL, was written in Java to support a C like language known as Jack. Since many Operating 
          Systems are built with a popular 3rd level language, this allowed us to understand how the computer is fundamentaly 
          working under the hood. The virtual computer we eventualluy built was able to run one of our final projects - a program 
          written completely in Jack.
