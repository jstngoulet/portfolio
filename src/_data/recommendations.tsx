          I had the privilege of managing Justin directly at HyreCar and was consistently impressed
          by his technical expertise and leadership. As Engineering Manager for the Driver Mobile
          Applications team, Justin successfully led a cross-functional team of iOS, Android, Web,
          and Backend engineers, delivering impactful features and collaborating with stakeholders
          to develop innovative products. Justin's ability to combine technical skills with
          strategic thinking makes him a standout professional. His leadership, collaborative
          mindset, and focus on delivering value would make him an asset to any organization. I
          wholeheartedly recommend him for roles where innovation and execution are paramount.

          Justin is an experienced engineer with a keen eye for navigating blockers. His business
          understanding and domain knowledge make him an asset to any company, particularly those
          utilizing customized marketplaces, gig work, or in the financial/insurance space.
          Technical understanding and a deep sense of ownership guarantee Justin's enthusiasm for
          his work, and he consistently brings productive ideas to the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we last worked together, he was resolute about implementing a particular payment
          feature that consistently received pushback from other parties. Justin patiently but
          consistently resurfaced it during roadmapping sessions for multiple quarters. When it was
          finally implemented, we clearly saw considerable income, reduced liability, and fewer
          agent hours spent with disgruntled customers. He truly cares about the success of the
          business and has the know-how to make an impact on your team.

          I was always very impressed working with Justin. He is a very diligent worker with a great
          work ethic. He is very dependable- punctual, on time, available whenever you need him, and
          he does what he says he’s going to do. Very trustworthy when it comes to delivery.

        <p>
          He also has a broad range of technical skills. Not only is he impressive develop
          developing on mobile platforms, but he is also very competent working with data,
          pipelines, databases, and back ends.

          I had the pleasure of working with Justin Goulet as my team lead, and I can confidently
          say he is one of the best iOS developers I’ve ever met. Justin’s technical expertise is
          unmatched—he’s a true pro who consistently delivers high-quality solutions and stays on
          top of the latest developments in iOS. His ability to tackle complex problems with ease
          sets him apart in the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond his technical skills, Justin is an exceptional leader. He managed our team
          flawlessly, fostering a positive and productive environment. His strong communication
          skills made collaboration smooth and efficient, and he always made sure everyone felt
          heard and supported. Justin’s leadership style not only kept us on track but also
          motivated us to perform at our best.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re looking for a highly skilled, reliable, and inspiring iOS developer and team
          lead, Justin is at the top of the league. Any team would be lucky to have him!

          I had the pleasure of working with Justin at HyreCar and Getaround for nearly 3 years. He
          was responsible for the HyreCar app and in that critical role, demonstrated an exceptional
          grasp of mobile development best practices and a deep commitment to delivering
          high-quality, user-centric experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Justin's an excellent out-of-the-box thinker who consistently brought creative solutions
          to challenging engineering problems -during my first week at HyreCar, we worked together
          to dive into the numbers and the code to identify a major bug that was impacting
          conversion. He then took ownership of the issue and fixed it within a day -I've been
          impressed with his output ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another rare trait: he brings a uniquely customer-centric approach to his role that
          ensured we delivered products that met the needs of our users and drove business success;
          more than just execution and writing of code, he demonstrated a true care for the customer
          (on both sides of the marketplace) and was a vocal advocate for delivering exceptional
          customer experiences.

        Tizzle is an outstanding engineer and lead. I worked with him when he was not only the iOS
        lead but also took a leading role in instrumenting the mobile apps for greater visibility
        and for producing numerous near real-time analytic reports. He consistently over delivered
        and I would highly recommend him. He is also a good, kind person.

          I had the distinct pleasure of working closely with Justin as the tech lead of our
          development team at HyreCar. His unparalleled technical acumen, visionary approach to
          problem solving, and remarkable understanding of our users and business make him a
          standout talent in his field.

        <p>
          Justin possesses a rare blend of technical mastery and business insight, that position him
          uniquely in the software development landscape. He was instrumental in building the iOS
          app from scratch, crafting an exceptional user experience for both our iOS and and Android
          apps. The impact of his work is reflected in the numbers as the apps under his leadership
          generated a vast majority of HyreCar’s revenue.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the tech lead for our development team, comprising of backend and frontend developers,
          Justin demonstrated an innate ability to stay calm under pressure, proposing innovative
          and feasible solutions to the most challenging technical problems. His exceptional ability
          to deconstruct complex technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders,was indispensable
          in promoting collaboration and understanding across different functional teams. Justin is
          not just a technical savant, but also an intuitive business thinker. He has consistently
          demonstrated a profound understanding of our users’ pain points, wants and needs leading
          to solutions that resolve these opportunities.

          confident Justin will continue to excel, driving significant contributions to any future
