          I was always very impressed working with Justin. He is a very diligent worker with a great
          work ethic. He is very dependable- punctual, on time, available whenever you need him, and
          he does what he says he’s going to do. Very trustworthy when it comes to delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          He also has a broad range of technical skills. Not only is he impressive develop
          developing on mobile platforms, but he is also very competent working with data,
          pipelines, databases, and back ends.

          I had the pleasure of working with Justin Goulet as my team lead, and I can confidently
          say he is one of the best iOS developers I’ve ever met. Justin’s technical expertise is
          unmatched—he’s a true pro who consistently delivers high-quality solutions and stays on
          top of the latest developments in iOS. His ability to tackle complex problems with ease
          sets him apart in the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond his technical skills, Justin is an exceptional leader. He managed our team
          flawlessly, fostering a positive and productive environment. His strong communication
          skills made collaboration smooth and efficient, and he always made sure everyone felt
          heard and supported. Justin’s leadership style not only kept us on track but also
          motivated us to perform at our best.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re looking for a highly skilled, reliable, and inspiring iOS developer and team
          lead, Justin is at the top of the league. Any team would be lucky to have him!

          I had the pleasure of working with Justin at HyreCar and Getaround for nearly 3 years. He
          was responsible for the HyreCar app and in that critical role, demonstrated an exceptional
          grasp of mobile development best practices and a deep commitment to delivering
          high-quality, user-centric experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Justin's an excellent out-of-the-box thinker who consistently brought creative solutions
          to challenging engineering problems -during my first week at HyreCar, we worked together
          to dive into the numbers and the code to identify a major bug that was impacting
          conversion. He then took ownership of the issue and fixed it within a day -I've been
          impressed with his output ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another rare trait: he brings a uniquely customer-centric approach to his role that
          ensured we delivered products that met the needs of our users and drove business success;
          more than just execution and writing of code, he demonstrated a true care for the customer
          (on both sides of the marketplace) and was a vocal advocate for delivering exceptional
          customer experiences.

        Tizzle is an outstanding engineer and lead. I worked with him when he was not only the iOS
        lead but also took a leading role in instrumenting the mobile apps for greater visibility
        and for producing numerous near real-time analytic reports. He consistently over delivered
        and I would highly recommend him. He is also a good, kind person.

          Justin possesses a rare blend of technical mastery and business insight, that position him
          uniquely in the software development landscape. He was instrumental in building the iOS
          app from scratch, crafting an exceptional user experience for both our iOS and and Android

          Justin demonstrated an innate ability to stay calm under pressure, proposing innovative
          and feasible solutions to the most challenging technical problems. His exceptional ability
          to deconstruct complex technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders,was indispensable
          in promoting collaboration and understanding across different functional teams. Justin is
          not just a technical savant, but also an intuitive business thinker. He has consistently
          demonstrated a profound understanding of our users’ pain points, wants and needs leading
          to solutions that resolve these opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, I endorse Justin for any technical leadership role. His unique blend of
